Smart Home Energy Management System - Challenges and Considerations

1. Relay Isolation:
   - Ensure relays are opto-isolated to prevent high voltage backflow and protect the Arduino.

2. Sensor Noise:
   - Analog sensors like TMP36 and LDR are prone to noise.
   - Use averaging/filtering techniques to get stable readings.

3. Power Supply Issues:
   - Relays can draw more current; power them externally if needed.
   - Avoid overloading the Arduino’s 5V line.

4. False Triggering in Relays:
   - Use hysteresis in threshold comparisons to prevent frequent switching.
   - Example: turn on fan at 30°C and off at 28°C.

5. LCD Visibility:
   - Ensure correct potentiometer adjustment for clear visibility.
   - May be unreadable in very bright light.

6. Cloud Integration (Optional):
   - Adding cloud platforms like Blynk, Firebase, or MQTT requires WiFi modules (ESP8266/ESP32).
   - Increases complexity but enables remote monitoring/control.

7. Component Compatibility:
   - Use components with compatible voltage/current ratings.
   - Check datasheets before integrating sensors and actuators.

8. Real-World Deployment:
   - Consider enclosures for safety.
   - Add surge protection and use solid-state relays for durability.
